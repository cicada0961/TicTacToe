# My First React Project

This is my very first project using React! ðŸŽ‰ I'm excited to learn and explore the world of front-end development with this powerful library. In this project, I've implemented a basic interactive game to get familiar with React concepts like components, props, and state management.

## About the Project

This project is a simple interactive game where players can click on squares to place either "X" or "O", similar to a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The goal is to learn how to handle events in React and to understand how states are updated and passed through components.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned:
- How to create React components and structure the project
- Managing state using React's `useState` hook
- Handling events like `onClick` to interact with the user
- Basic conditional rendering based on the game state
- Passing props to child components and using callback functions

## Features

- Simple user interface with clickable squares
- A button to restart the game
- Win detection logic to declare a winner
- Message displaying the current player or the winner

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cicada0961/TicTacToe.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd my-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Next Steps

This is just the beginning! In future projects, I plan to:
- Add more features to this game
- Dive deeper into React, including more advanced hooks and libraries
- Explore back-end integration and state management with Redux

Thank you for checking out my first React project! ðŸ˜Š I'm looking forward to growing and improving my skills as I continue to learn.
